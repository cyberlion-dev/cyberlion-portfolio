⚠ Open-Ended Support Chatbot

  Trust Risk: 5/5

--- PHILOSOPHY ---

Customer-facing AI can be extremely effective when it is explicit,
opt-in, and well-supported. Poorly implemented AI tends to frustrate
customers and damage trust. We recommend starting with back-office
improvements that deliver value without customer-facing risk.
