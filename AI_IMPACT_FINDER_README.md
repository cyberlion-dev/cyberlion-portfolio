# AI Impact Finder - Complete Guide

## Overview

The AI Impact Finder helps business owners identify high-value AI opportunities through transparent, heuristic-based scoring. It discourages poorly-implemented customer-facing AI while highlighting safe, effective back-office improvements.

## ✨ Features

- **6-Question Assessment** - Quick survey to understand business needs
- **12 AI Use Cases** - Comprehensive registry of AI opportunities
- **Transparent Scoring** - Explainable recommendations (no black boxes)
- **Customer-Facing AI Gating** - Suppresses high-risk options when inappropriate
- **Confidence Labeling** - High/medium/low based on answer alignment
- **Copy & Download** - Save results to clipboard or text file
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Dark Mode Support** - Respects user theme preferences

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run locally
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/ai-impact-finder

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## File Structure

```
├── data/
│   ├── ai-use-cases.json          # 12 AI use cases with scoring data
│   └── questionnaire.json         # 6 questions with signal mappings
├── lib/
│   └── ai-impact-scoring.ts       # Scoring engine (no ML, pure logic)
├── components/
│   └── AIImpactFinder.tsx         # Main React component
└── app/
    └── ai-impact-finder/
        └── page.tsx               # Test page
```

## How It Works

### Scoring Algorithm

```
For each AI use case:

1. Calculate Opportunity Score
   opportunityScore = normalize(baseImpact + sum(signals))

2. Apply Penalties
   trustPenalty = customerTrustRisk
   maturityPenalty = max(0, (maturityRequired - userCapability) * 2)

3. Calculate Net Value
   netValue = opportunityScore - trustPenalty - maturityPenalty

4. Determine Confidence
   signals >= 3: High confidence
   signals == 2: Medium confidence
   signals <= 1: Low confidence

5. Apply Gating Rules
   Suppress customer-facing AI if maturityRequired > userCapability
```

### Results Format

**Section A: Summary** - How results were determined
**Section B: Top 2 Recommendations** - Best opportunities with explanations
**Section C: Use Cautiously** - Suppressed or high-risk items (required)
**Section D: Philosophy** - Statement on customer-facing AI
**Section E: CTA** - Low-pressure contact option

**NEW:** Copy and Download buttons in header

## Copy/Download Feature

Users can now save their results in two ways:

1. **Copy to Clipboard** (📋 Copy button)
   - Copies formatted text version
   - Shows "✓ Copied!" confirmation
   - Works on all modern browsers

2. **Download as Text File** (💾 Download button)
   - Downloads as `.txt` file
   - Filename includes date: `ai-impact-results-2026-01-24.txt`
   - Clean, readable format

## Customization

### Change CTA Link

[components/AIImpactFinder.tsx:320](components/AIImpactFinder.tsx#L320)

```typescript
href="https://cyberlion.dev/contact"
```

### Add/Remove Use Cases

Edit [data/ai-use-cases.json](data/ai-use-cases.json):

```json
{
  "id": "new-use-case",
  "title": "Your Use Case",
  "description": "...",
  "baseImpact": 7,
  "customerTrustRisk": 2,
  "maturityRequired": 3,
  "customerFacing": false,
  "requiresOptIn": false,
  "examples": ["Example 1", "Example 2"]
}
```

Then add signals in [data/questionnaire.json](data/questionnaire.json).

### Modify Questions

Edit [data/questionnaire.json](data/questionnaire.json):

```json
{
  "id": "your-question",
  "question": "Your question text?",
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "option-1",
      "label": "Option label",
      "signals": {
        "use-case-id": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adjust Scoring

Edit [lib/ai-impact-scoring.ts](lib/ai-impact-scoring.ts):

- Normalization range (line 148)
- Maturity penalty multiplier (line 157)
- Confidence thresholds (line 222)

## Embedding Options

### Option 1: Next.js Page (Current)
Already configured at `/ai-impact-finder`

### Option 2: Component Import
```tsx
import AIImpactFinder from '@/components/AIImpactFinder';

export default function YourPage() {
  return <AIImpactFinder />;
}
```

### Option 3: iframe Embed
```html
<iframe src="https://yourdomain.com/ai-impact-finder"
        width="100%" height="900"></iframe>
```

## Testing

### Test Personas

**Persona 1: Small Business, Low Tech**
- Business: Local service
- Time drain: Customer questions
- Tech: Beginner
- Customer interaction: None
- Expected: Email drafting, process automation (no customer-facing)

**Persona 2: SaaS, High Tech**
- Business: SaaS
- Time drain: Reporting
- Tech: Expert
- Customer interaction: Simple assistance
- Expected: Decision support, opt-in FAQ

**Persona 3: Professional Services**
- Business: Consulting
- Time drain: Proposals
- Tech: Intermediate
- Customer interaction: None
- Expected: Proposal drafting, knowledge base

### Test Copy/Download

1. Complete questionnaire
2. Click "📋 Copy" - verify clipboard contains formatted text
3. Click "💾 Download" - verify file downloads with date in filename
4. Open downloaded file - verify formatting is readable

## Design Principles

1. **Transparency** - Every score is explainable
2. **Safety** - Gatekeeping for risky customer-facing AI
3. **Clarity** - Qualitative labels over fake precision
4. **Honesty** - Shows what won't work, not just what will
5. **Utility** - Results can be saved and shared

## Constraints Met

- ✓ No Monte Carlo simulations
- ✓ No probability percentages
- ✓ No black-box ML
- ✓ No buzzwords
- ✓ No forced customer-facing AI
- ✓ All recommendations explainable
- ✓ Results are portable (copy/download)

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

Copy to clipboard requires HTTPS in production (works in localhost without).

## Performance

- Initial load: ~7.4 KB (component only)
- First Load JS: ~123 KB (total)
- Static generation: ✓ Pre-rendered
- No external API calls
- Instant client-side scoring

## Troubleshooting

**Copy button doesn't work?**
- Check HTTPS (required in production)
- Try Firefox/Chrome if Safari has issues
- Check browser console for errors

**Download button doesn't work?**
- Check browser allows downloads
- Try different browser
- Check popup blocker settings

**Build fails?**
- Run `npm run build` to see errors
- Check TypeScript errors
- Verify JSON syntax in data files

## Next Steps

1. Test locally with `npm run dev`
2. Try all three personas
3. Test copy/download features
4. Customize CTA link if needed
5. Deploy with your standard process
